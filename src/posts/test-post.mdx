## What is Ownership?

Ownership is Rust's approach to memory management. Here are the key rules:

1. Each value has an owner
2. There can only be one owner at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped

## Example Code

```rust
fn main() {
    // s1 owns the String
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    // Move ownership to s2
    let s2 = s1;

    // This would cause a compile error:
    // println!("{}", s1);

    println!("{}", s2);
}
```
