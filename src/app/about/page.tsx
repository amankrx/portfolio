              My journey in technology began at{' '}
              <strong>
                Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur
              </strong>
              , where I earned a BTech in Computer Science. It was there that I
              discovered my passion for systems programming and designing
              efficient software architectures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, I&#39;m a Backend Developer at{' '}
              <strong>Fortanix</strong>, where I specialize in creating secure,
              scalable distributed systems. My work revolves around pushing the
              limits of secure computing, exploring innovative ways to enhance
              system security and performance.
            </p>

            <p>
              I&#39;m deeply invested in systems programming, particularly with{' '}
              <strong>Rust</strong>. Its balance of memory safety and
              performance captivated me, and it&#39;s now my go-to language for
              critical systems projects. I actively contribute to the Rust
              ecosystem, driven by a belief in the power of open-source
              collaboration.

              Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology
              and creativity. Optimizing my development environment is one of my
              favorite pursuitsâ€”whether it&#39;s experimenting with mechanical
              keyboards or setting up ergonomic monitor configurations. I
              believe that the right tools elevate both productivity and
              satisfaction.

            <p>
              Music is my creative outlet, with fingerstyle guitar as my primary
              focus. The precision and expressiveness of this playing style
              resonate deeply with me. In many ways, the discipline required to
              master fingerstyle techniques mirrors the dedication needed in
              software development.
