Systems programmer, backend developer, and fingerstyle guitarist. Welcome to my corner of the web!

My journey in technology began at

<strong>Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur</strong>, where I
earned a BTech in Computer Science. It was there that I discovered my passion
for systems programming and designing efficient software architectures.

Currently, I'm a Backend Developer at

<strong>Fortanix</strong>, where I specialize in creating secure, scalable
distributed systems. My work revolves around pushing the limits of secure
computing, exploring innovative ways to enhance system security and performance.

I&#39;m deeply invested in systems programming, particularly with{' '}

<strong>Rust</strong>. Its balance of memory safety and performance captivated
me, and it's now my go-to language for critical systems projects. I actively
contribute to the Rust ecosystem, driven by a belief in the power of open-source
collaboration.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and creativity.
Optimizing my development environment is one of my favorite pursuitsâ€”whether
it's experimenting with mechanical keyboards or setting up ergonomic monitor
configurations. I believe that the right tools elevate both productivity and
satisfaction.

Music is my creative outlet, with fingerstyle guitar as my primary
endeavor. The precision and expressiveness of this playing style
resonate deeply with me. In many ways, the discipline required to
master fingerstyle techniques mirrors the dedication needed in
software development.

## Let's Connect

I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers, tech enthusiasts, and musicians. Whether it's discussing system architecture, debating programming paradigms, sharing guitar tips, or exploring new collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out.
