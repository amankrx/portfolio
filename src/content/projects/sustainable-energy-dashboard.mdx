# Sustainable Energy Dashboard

An interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into renewable energy production and consumption patterns. The platform helps energy companies and consumers make data-driven decisions about energy usage.

## Current Progress

- Completed: Data collection pipeline, basic visualization components
- In Progress: Machine learning forecasting models
- Planned: User customization features

## Architecture

The system uses InfluxDB for time-series data storage, with a Node.js backend processing and serving data to a Vue.js frontend. D3.js powers the interactive visualizations.
