## Project Structure
These project consists of two libraries:
- **[itch-parser](https://github.com/amankrx/matching-engine-rs/itch-parser)**: This library is responsible for managing the processing of *NASDAQ ITCH 5.0* protocol data. It parses the useful fields that will be required for the Limit Order Book. The remaining fields are skipped using placeholders. Check out the folder's [README](https://github.com/amankrx/matching-engine-rs/itch-parser/README.md) for more information.
- **[optimized-lob](https://github.com/amankrx/matching-engine-rs/optimized-lob)**: This library contains a streamlined and efficient implementation of a Limit Order Book (LOB). It is worth noting that the LOB simply stores a few useful fields that will be required for creating a LOB. It just keeps an aggregate quantities at each level. Check out the folder's [README](https://github.com/amankrx/matching-engine-rs/optimized-lob/README.md) for more information.

Apart from that, there is a testing suite for both libraries that can be found in the "[tests](https://github.com/amankrx/matching-engine-rs/tests)" directory.

## Build, Run, and Test
Make sure you have Rust installed. Also, you must download the NASDAQ ITCH 5.0 data whose instructions are available in the [ITCH Specifications](#ITCH-Specifications).
All of these operations are performed in the `tests` directory.
```bash
cd tests
```
### Build
```bash
cargo build
```
or
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running the LOB
```bash
ITCH_DATA=PATH_TO_ITCH_DATA_FILE cargo run
```
or
```bash
ITCH_DATA=PATH_TO_ITCH_DATA_FILE cargo run --release
```

### Running the ITCH parser
```bash
ITCH_DATA=PATH_TO_ITCH_DATA_FILE cargo run -- --itch-parser
```
or
```bash
ITCH_DATA=PATH_TO_ITCH_DATA_FILE cargo run --release -- --itch-parser
```

### Testing
```bash
cargo test
```
