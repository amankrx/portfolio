# Blockchain Supply Chain Tracker

A decentralized application (DApp) for tracking products through the supply chain, ensuring transparency and authenticity through blockchain technology.

## Planned Features

- Smart contract-based product tracking
- QR code integration for physical products
- Decentralized storage for product documentation
- Real-time status updates and notifications
- Stakeholder verification system

The system will use Ethereum smart contracts for tracking ownership and transfer of goods, with IPFS storing related documentation and images.
