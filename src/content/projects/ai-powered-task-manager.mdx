# AI-Powered Task Manager

Our intelligent task management system revolutionizes how teams organize their work. Using machine learning algorithms, it automatically categorizes tasks, suggests priorities, and learns from user behavior to provide increasingly accurate recommendations.

## Key Features

- Natural language task processing
- Automatic task categorization
- Smart priority suggestions
- Team workload analysis
- Performance analytics dashboard

## Technical Implementation

The system uses TensorFlow for the machine learning components, with a FastAPI backend serving predictions through a RESTful API. The frontend is built with React and uses real-time updates via WebSocket connections.
